## ✨ Cool Enhancement

I added two cool features to enhance the gameplay and aesthetics:

1. **Green Boundary Around the Player Ship**  
   A glowing green boundary was added around the player’s ship to provide visual clarity and a sleek, sci-fi feel to the game. This also helps players quickly identify their ship during high-action scenes.

2. **Weapon Mode Switching**  
   I implemented a feature that allows players to switch between shooting modes. This adds tactical depth and replayability, letting players decide how they want to engage enemies.
